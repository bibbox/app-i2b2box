Only the cells are installed. No ontology or demo data are available. 
Two methods can be used to put data inside the machine: 
-low level access. Data, ontology and administration info are inserted through SQL statements.
-medium level access. The tables are filled via xml files. 
-high level access. The fhir interface can be used, though only a part of the fhir protocol is understood presently.
